# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Security fixes are applied to the latest code in the `main` branch. Older revisions may not receive security updates.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in this project:

1. Please use GitHub’s private security advisory workflow at `https://github.com/rovaip/www/security/advisories/new` to share details with the maintainers, **or**
2. If that is not available, open a minimal public issue stating that you have found a security vulnerability and would like to disclose it privately.

When reporting, include as much detail as possible to help us reproduce and assess impact (affected URLs or components, steps to reproduce, expected vs. actual behavior, and any relevant logs or screenshots).

We aim to respond to valid reports in a reasonable timeframe and will coordinate disclosure as appropriate.
